# LED controller

This controller is written for the ESP8266 and my first attempt to do something with embedded webservers. This controller is made to control a non-addressable RGB strip via a webinterface. A color can be picked from a colorwheel and the selected color will be displayed on the LEDstrip.

A live (non functional) preview van be seen here https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ProAce/led_controller/blob/master/index.html
